I am a second-year Ph.D. student working on cryptography in the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington. I am co-advised by [Stefano Tessaro](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~tessaro/) and [Rachel Lin](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rachel/).

Prior to this, I received my bachelor's degree from [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/) at Tsinghua University. I was visiting [CMU](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) during 2019, working under the supervision of [Vipul Goyal](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~goyal/) on cryptography.

I have a broad interest in cryptography and related fields of theoretical computer science. I love solving concrete, discrete problems. My current focus is on various signature schemes, such as blind signatures and threshold signatures.
